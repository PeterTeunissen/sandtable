Movies are specified in an XML file that expresses the various keyframes that should be drawn.
Drawings (Things) with parameters (Params) are used within the keyframes (Frame) to control
what is drawn and when.  Interpolation is automatically done between keyframes.

    <Thing Type="type">                     # One or more Things can be used to "erase" the table.

The table below lists the Types of Things, and the first column indicates the Name for Params.
The other columns briefly describe the fields and their units.""", quote=True)
